# ETHEREUM DATA ANALYSIS

# Project Overview
This report presents a detailed analysis of Ethereum transaction data, focusing on transaction frequency, value distribution, gas usage, and the relationship between transaction value and gas price. Key findings include a high frequency of transactions from certain addresses, a wide distribution of transaction values, and a positive correlation between transaction value and gas price.

# Introduction
With the growing popularity of Ethereum, thereâ€™s a need to understand transaction patterns to inform investment and trading strategies. This analysis aims to uncover insights from Ethereum transaction data, specifically focusing on transaction frequency, value distribution, gas usage, and the relationship between transaction value and gas price. The data includes transaction details such as block number, timestamp, from address, to address, value, gas price, and gas used.

# Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Tableau Public, a powerful data visualization tool. The data was first cleaned and transformed, including converting timestamps to a readable format. The analysis involved calculating descriptive statistics, creating visualizations, and conducting a correlation analysis.

# Results and Discussion


# Conclussion
The analysis of Ethereum transaction data provided valuable insights into transaction patterns, value distribution, and gas usage. These findings could inform investment and trading strategies, and suggest that further research could investigate the reasons behind these patterns.
