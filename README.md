# ETHEREUM DATA ANALYSIS

# Project Overview
This report presents a detailed analysis of Ethereum transaction data, focusing on transaction frequency, value distribution, gas usage, and the relationship between transaction value and gas price. Key findings include a high frequency of transactions from certain addresses, a wide distribution of transaction values, and a positive correlation between transaction value and gas price.

# Introduction
With the growing popularity of Ethereum, thereâ€™s a need to understand transaction patterns to inform investment and trading strategies. This analysis aims to uncover insights from Ethereum transaction data, specifically focusing on transaction frequency, value distribution, gas usage, and the relationship between transaction value and gas price. The data includes transaction details such as block number, timestamp, from address, to address, value, gas price, and gas used.

# Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Tableau Public, a powerful data visualization tool. The data was first cleaned and transformed, including converting timestamps to a readable format. The analysis involved calculating descriptive statistics, creating visualizations, and conducting a correlation analysis.

# Results and Discussion

![Transaction made by each address over time](https://github.com/vincentakulinda/Ethereum-Blockchain-Data-Analysis/assets/40827558/31aacf82-c4f4-469c-bca4-f48a46d49b62)
## Interpretation
- The chart  show the number of transactions made by each address over time. Here are interpretations and conclusions that can be drawn:
- Spike in Transactions: There was a significant increase in transactions in 2017 and 2018. This could indicate a period of high activity or interest in Ethereum during these years.
- Decrease in Transactions: There was a decrease in transactions in 2019 and 2020. This could suggest a decrease in activity or interest, or perhaps changes in the Ethereum network that affected transaction volume.
- Slight Increase in Recent Years: There appears to be a slight increase in transactions in 2021 and 2022. This could indicate a resurgence of activity or interest.

## Interpretation
- From the  line graph showing the amount of gas used by each address over time. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the amount of gas used. The graph appears to show a decrease in gas usage over time. This could indicate that the addresses are either conducting fewer transactions over time or the transactions they are conducting are becoming less complex (and thus require less gas).

## Interpretation 
- The visualization indicates that there is a positive correlation between transaction value and gas price, meaning that the higher the value, the higher the gas price. This suggests that the address was willing to pay more gas to ensure faster and more secure transactions.

## Interpretation
- The visualization  shows that some address  paid higher gas prices than the average, as most of the points are above the trend line.

# Conclussion
The analysis of Ethereum transaction data provided valuable insights into transaction patterns, value distribution, and gas usage. These findings could inform investment and trading strategies, and suggest that further research could investigate the reasons behind these patterns.
